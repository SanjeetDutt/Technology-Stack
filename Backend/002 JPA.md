# UUIDS
- need to select primary key for a table
	- Integer
		- 4 bytes = range from 0 to 2^32 -1
	- Long
		- 8 byte = range from 0 to 10^18
		- Collision between shardes
		- Security problem because of serial number
	- Server ID / Mac Address / IP Address
		- Chances of collision is reduces or removed
		- latency will increase
			- As process is async and second request need to hold till the first request resolved in one server
	- server_ id and Timestamp
		- We need not to wait in this case until 2 request is made in same milli-second
		- EPOCH
			- DD MM YYYY HH MM SS MS to unique number in 13 to 14 digits
			- Example : 1740071483
			- Decoded :  Thursday, February 20, 2025 5:11:23 PM
		- Changes of collision decreases
		- Security will improved
- Universal Unique Identities
	- 128 bits = 16 digits
	- Also know as GUID in C#
	- UUID in Java
- Stored inform of hexa-decimal form
	- This cannot be stores as bits as managing bits is difficult (128 chars)
	- 16 hexa-decimal character 
	- Spring has special UUID data type
- Representing UUID in Data base
	- Ref : https://thorben-janssen.com/complete-guide-inheritance-strategies-jpa-hibernate/
	- Table per class
		- let
			- User = name, email
			- TA  = name, email, rating
			- Mentor = name, email, hours
			- Instructor  = name, email, company
		- To get all user, we need to joins here (expensive)
		- Inheritance strategy = TABLE_PER_CLASS
	- Foreign Key Relationship Joined class
		- let
			- user  = name, email
			- TA = rating, user id
			- Mentor = hours, user id
			- Instructor = company; user id
		-  Inheritance strategy = JOINED
		- Here user_id will be primary key and foreign table of the table
		- Joint will needed to get data of all user
		- Data will be inconsistency -> transaction
	- Combined tables or Single table
		- let
			- user = name, email, hours, rating, company, user_type
		- Too many Nulls, too many space needed
		-  Inheritance strategy = SINGLE_TABLE
	- In case when we want to use abstract class
		- let 
			- abstract class X = a, b
			- animal extends X = e, f
			- Fish Net extends X = g, h
		- Table will made like combined table
		- Known as Mapped super class

# Id declaration in JPA

- Generated values
	- name itself suggests that it will generate something
	- annotation is generally used in conjunction with @Id annotation to automatically generate unique values for primary key columns within our database tables
	- t will instruct hibernate to automatically generate a unique value for that field during **the process of persisting the entity into the database**
	- Types
		- IDENTITY
			- This strategy will help us to generate the primary key value by the database itself using the auto-increment column option. It relies on the database’s native support for generating unique values.
		- AUTO
			- This is a default strategy and the persistence provider which automatically selects an appropriate generation strategy based on the database usage.
		- TABLE
			- This strategy uses a separate database table to generate primary key values. The persistence provider manages this table and uses it to allocate unique values for primary keys.
		- SEQUENCE 
			- This generation-type strategy uses a database sequence to generate primary key values. It requires the usage of database sequence objects, which varies depending on the database which is being used.
# Joining Columns
![[Pasted image 20250302112520.png]]
- Step to join columns
	1. Decode cardinality learned in SQL
	2. Annotate the  property like
		- While calculating cardinality we did
		- ![[Pasted image 20250302113036.png]]
		- According to this
			- N product belong to 1 category
			- 1 Category belong to N product
		- So 
			- In category table or entity
				- 1 category belong to N products
				- so OneToMany  Annotation
			- In Product table or entity
				- N product belong to 1 category
				- so ManyToOne Annotation
	3. In Either of the table we have to write the @JoinColumn annotation or in both we can

		- Hibernate is self intelligent to put the join column in right place
