- basically, it is abbreviation of
	- ## Consistency ##
		- every time you want to do a read operation, you will get the value of **latest version** or **latest write**
		- all replica or machine will have the same view of data
	- ## Availability ##
		- if you send a query, the system must be **available to give you the response**
		- at least one machine should be running at any point of time
	- ## Partition Tolerance##
		- it is referred to **network**
		- A network partition is a **division** of a computer network into **relatively independent subnets**, either by design, to optimize them separately, or due to the failure of network devices.
		- the cluster must continue to work despite any number of communication breakdowns between nodes in the system.
			- a cluster isÂ a **group of servers** and other resources that **act like a single system** and enable high availability, load balancing and parallel processing
		- system, which is able to handle the event of network partitioning called partition tolerance system
- according to this theorem, any system can provide **only two out of above three guarantee**.
	- means if we adopt partition tolerance, inability, then we cannot have consistency
	- or if we adopt partition tolerance and consistency, we cannot ensure availability
- in distributed system, 
	- partition tolerance is already given due to architecture. 
	- So we have to select either from consistency or availability.
- but in single system
	-  there is no partition tolerance
	- hence we can have both consistency and availability as per CAP theorem
- but in reality, for having a good
	- immediate consistency and availability
	- basically, we design a distributed system with availability and partition tolerance
		- and we introduce latency in consistency, which make a system, non-immediate consistency
		- which means system will return the updated value after few moment of time?
