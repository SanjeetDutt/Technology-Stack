# OLAP  / Online Analytical Processing
- An OLAP system isÂ a database technology that helps businesses analyse and report on large amounts of data
- It combine data from multiple sources into a multi dimensional format
- Data are usually stored in **Data ware house**
	- Used for storing a large size of data usually in TeraByte, PentaByte, etc.
	- Data should be structured in form of tables
	- Table should be in denormalized form
		- Normalized data is organized into multiple tables 
		- denormalized data is combined into a single table
		- Joins are expensive process
# Dimensional Modelling ##
- Need to design 2 type of table
	- ## Fact Table
		- Where action going to happen
		- it is a place where all core data is stored
			- core data 
				- Business Matrix that can be evaluate and measure
				- They contain number
				- They contain foreign key 
			- Example :
				- price 
				- total sales
				- quantity
				- discount
				- profit margin
				- Revenue
				- customer id => to connect another table to get more insight (Dimension table)
	 - ## Dimension Table ##
		 - It is the table with which we are connecting our fact table
		 - They provide context to your data
		 - Help to make more sense of the raw data in the fat table
		 - Contains description attribute
## Example on healthcare
- Fact table
	- Treat cost
	- discount
	- Registration
	- insured covered amount
	- diagnosis code
	- medication cost
- Dimension table
	- Patient id
	- name
	- contact number
## Example on E-Commerce
- Fact Table
	- Customer Id
	- Product id
	- date (Foreign key to date dimension)
- Dimension table
	- Product
		- Product id
		- name
		- category
		- Brand
		- unit price
	- Customer
		- Customer Id
		- name
		- gender
		- location
	- Date Dimensions 
		- Date 
		- Year
		- quarter
		- month
		- day of week
		- is holiday

# Schema Designing
- It help to understand how we can arrange data so that data can fetch faster
- ## Star Schema
	- According to it, fact table should be in centre
	- ![[Pasted image 20250217224945.png]]
	- Example
	- ![[Pasted image 20250217224258.png]]
		- Total dimension table = 4
		- Total fact table = 1
			- Foreign key in fact table = 4 (Asin act as foreign of 2 table)
	- Why to use star schema
		- Easy to understand
		- fast performance
		- **Some redundancy**
	- Used 80% in industry
- # Snowflake Schema
	- When you need more normalization
	- It is used to remove redundancy records
	- this schema design has
		- 1 fact table
		- Multi-level dimension table
		- ![[Pasted image 20250217225615.png]]
		- But this will have joining the table problem 
	- Used in 50% in industry
- # Galaxy schema
	- Also know as Fact constellation
	- Used 8% in industry
	- a data modelling technique that uses multiple fact tables and dimension tables
	- ![[Pasted image 20250217230741.png]]
	- Fact and fact table are not connected
